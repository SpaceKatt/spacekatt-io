# Initial Design Intent

This population migration simulation is meant to model the movement of people among population centers - and to be a vessel for learning D3.js.

## Background

People often move among cities.

Migration patterns of humans may be analyzed through the application of a Markov chain.

Markovian processes may be represented by a fully connected graph who evolves through time.

Nodes represent population centers; edges represent the probability of a randomly chosen individual will transition between population centers (or remain put).

Discrete turns represent sampled points on a quantized frequency in this virtual world.
