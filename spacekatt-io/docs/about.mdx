Thomas "SpaceKatt" Kercheval is a human, artist, and competent software engineer.

Storytelling is foundational to the human experience.
Language, technology, and art all live within metaphors we share to reason about the world.
The hero's journey is a vessel through which we rationalize our world.

The International SpaceKatt Station is SpaceKatt's vessel for storytelling.
[Technical](/tech) and [artistic](/art) endevours are documented for the reader.
Often, we can learn as much documenting and sharing stories as we do in the original experience itself.
