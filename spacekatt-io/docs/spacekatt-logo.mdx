Year after year I found myself drawing the same abstract plant-creature in every notebook and margin.
After a decade or so, this creature was used as the inspiration for the logo I plaster over my work.

Evolution of the SpaceKatt logo is expounded upon below!

## Current Version

Here lies ~~dragons~~ the current version of the SpaceKatt logo:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/spacekatt-logo.svg"
    alt="Current SpaceKatt logo"
    title="Current SpaceKatt logo"
    style={{ maxHeight: '400px' }}
  />
</div>

## Pupil Change and Smooting Eye Corners (v4)

Many folk asked if the symbol in the eye of previous logo versions was the division operation.
However, it was merely meant to be a reflection, one that I was never satisfied with.
Now, the reflection is a more "kawaii-like" sparkle!

Sharp corners in the eye were throwing off the whole vibe, so the corners were smoothed out in symmetry of their context.

`v4` of the SpaceKatt logo in all of its glory:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/logo-design/spacekatt-logo-v4v2.svg"
    alt="Current SpaceKatt logo"
    title="Current SpaceKatt logo"
    style={{ maxHeight: '400px' }}
  />
</div>

## Rounding the Corners (v3)

Characters in children's shows often feature smooth corners.
Human brains oft interpret sharp edges as dangerous and rounded corners as more calming.
For this reason, corners were smoothed out in the new iteration of the logo.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/logo-design/corner-comp.png"
    alt="Corner comparison between v2 and v3 of the SpaceKatt logo"
    title="Corner comparison between v2 and v3 of the SpaceKatt logo"
    style={{ maxHeight: '900px' }}
  />
</div>
<br />

`v3` of the SpaceKatt logo in all of its glory:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/logo-design/spacekatt-logo-v3.svg"
    alt="v3 SpaceKatt logo"
    title="v3 SpaceKatt logo"
    style={{ maxHeight: '400px' }}
  />
</div>

## Updating the Green (v2)

Folk mentioned the pink and green colors in the [first version](#first-version) were a little too
"close" together, which caused a slight visual unpleasentness.

To remedy this issue, I decided to make the green color a little darker.
It was a suble change that had a large impact on how folk preceived it!

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/logo-design/color-comp.png"
    alt="Color comparison between v1 and v2 of the SpaceKatt logo"
    title="Color comparison between v1 and v2 of the SpaceKatt logo"
    style={{ maxHeight: '900px' }}
  />
</div>
<br />

`v2` of the SpaceKatt logo in all of its glory:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/logo-design/spacekatt-logo-v2.svg"
    alt="v2 SpaceKatt logo"
    title="v2 SpaceKatt logo"
    style={{ maxHeight: '400px' }}
  />
</div>

## First Version (v1)

The first version of the logo established the general color theme and various shapes constituent to the logo design.

The overall form factor is based upon a doodle I've been drawing since ~2008. Originally, the doodle had a more
abstract shape which was normalized to a circle (in the interest of fitting on a button).

    alt="First version of SpaceKatt logo"
