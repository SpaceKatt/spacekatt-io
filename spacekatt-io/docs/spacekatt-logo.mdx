Here one can find the evolution of the design behind the SpaceKatt logo.

## Current Version

Here you can see the current version of the logo.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/spacekatt-logo.svg"
    alt="Current SpaceKatt logo"
    title="Current SpaceKatt logo"
    style={{ maxHeight: '400px' }}
  />
</div>

## Updating the Green

Folk mentioned the pink and green colors in the [first version](#first-version) were a little too
"close" together, which caused a slight visual unpleasentness.

To remedy this issue, I decided to make the green color a little darker.
It was a suble change that had a large impact on how folk preceived it!

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/logo-design/color-comp.png"
    alt="Color comparison between v1 and v2 of the SpaceKatt logo"
    title="Color comparison between v1 and v2 of the SpaceKatt logo"
    style={{ maxHeight: '900px' }}
  />
</div>

## First Version

The first version of the logo established the general color theme and various shapes constituent to the logo design.

The overall form factor is based upon a doodle I've been drawing since ~2008. Originally, the doodle had a more
abstract shape which was normalized to a circle (in the interest of fitting on a button).

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/logo-design/spacekatt-logo-old-green.png"
    alt="First version of SpaceKatt logo"
    title="First version of SpaceKatt logo"
    style={{ maxHeight: '400px' }}
  />
</div>
