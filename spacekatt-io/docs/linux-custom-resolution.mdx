title: How to Set Custom Monitor Resolution in Ubuntu 20.04
sidebar_label: Force Linux Monitor Resolution
---

This is the story of how I learned to set custom resolution in Linux for unknown monitors with invalid EDID.

## Intro

Recently, I bought an [Adafruit 7" 800x480 Display Backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2407).

**InsertProductPicture**

Minimalist, HMDI capable, and reminiscent of a Swiss Army Knife, this monitor brought joy to my heart as I imagined the ways it could be used.
Passive heat flowing from a Raspberry Pi brought me warmth from its first successful application, a simple kiosk.

**However!** Requirements change.

Environnmental considerations pleaded for a new compute mechanism and the introduction of Ubuntu 20.04, replacing the Pi.
Unknown waters as they were, the 800x480 Display Backpack's manual provided by Adafruit only covers the operation of the screen with a Pi.
Ubuntu was an entirely different beast.

My first swim ended in sudden, unforgiving _failure_.

Now, we can study why I failed and how you can _succeed!_

Let's dive right in.

## Background

> “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe”
> \- Carl Sagan

An understanding of a system's component requires, almost paradoxically, an understanding of the system.

To understand why a fresh Ubuntu distribution would fail to a blank screen - but only after a second or two of successfully display at boot - we must first grapple with the basics of Ubuntu's graphics system, the HDMI protocol, and the 7 inch Adafruit monitor itself.

### Ubuntu Graphics Environemnt

Ubuntu Desktop comes with a fully functional graphics environment. To better understand this stack, we briefly explore GNOME, X11, and DRM/KMS.

> Note, this environment is not installed by default on Ubuntu Server.
> However, one could easily set up this environment on Ubuntu Server with `# apt install gnome-session gnome-terminal`.

#### GNOME

GNOME is a desktop environment which comes bundled with Ubuntu 20.04.
As a [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment), it provides the user with a set of menus, icons, and a widget toolkit for building GUI elements.
New Ubuntu users are greeted with the GNOME environment.

GNOME is built from many components.

GDM3 is GNOME's display manager which manages the login screen.
GDM3 may be configured (in `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf`) to provide fun functionality at login, such as automatic logic

GNOME is built on X11 (or Wayland) which in turn handles things like input/output events, a window engine, and a display server.
GDM3 preloads X11 for GNOME, to ensure a visually smooth login experience.
While [differences between GNOME and X11](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/464321) are beyond the scope of this article,
we still wish to introduce X11.

#### X11

X11 - a.k.a X, X Window System, X Windows - is a windowing system composed of several components.

X.Org (Xorg) is an open source implementation of the X server.

Wayland is a popular, alternative Display Manager (and [Wayland's differences from Xorg](https://www.secjuice.com/wayland-vs-xorg/) are beyond the scope of this article).

#### Linux DRM and KMS

The Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) is a Linux kernel subsystem which provides an abstraction of the GPU to applications in userspace.
Processes render graphics through DRM by leveraging the `libdrm` API, which facilitates `ioctl()` syscalls to DRM devices at special device files (located in `/dev/dri/card*`).
The DRM layer acts as a job orchestrator, enabling processes to coordinate GPU acceleration among themselves.

> Previously, graphics in Linux were managed with an API called `fbdev` which required programs to manually manage framebuffers - their bitmaps for display.
> GPU hardware integration introduced scheduling complexities in framebuffer management, as a result jobs could be scheduled over one another and cause catastrophe.
> Applications experienced undefined behavior as they fought to control the device.
> The DRM was introduced to manage these scheduling complexities among client applications, handle GPU resource allocation/deallocation, and provide a consistent API across heterogeneous GPU hardware.

Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) is what enables the kernel to set a display mode on the video card (i.e., [mode setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_setting)).
A display mode is defined by a monitor's resolution, color depth, and refresh rate.
Displays will usually declare which modes they support through the Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) metadata format.
In a nutshell, KMS allows us to create a pipeline from a collection of bitmaps to an aggregate output display.

A CRT Controllers (CRTC) is derived from the set display mode and is responsible for creating input planes and output encoders.
Input planes specify the dimensions of graphical bitmaps to be displayed; output encoders specify how data should be formatted for any attached connector.
A KMS pipeline is defined by the CRTC, userspace framebuffers to populate the input planes, and connectors to consume output from the encoders.
For example, an application in an Xorg window may constitute framebuffer input and an HMDI monitor may be displaying the connector's output.

> [Cathode-ray tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube) (the CRT in CRTC) monitors are now obsolete.
> However, their design has lasting ripple-effects on the design of modern day protocols.
> Display signal timing and VSYNC/HSYNC signals have their roots in this antiquated technology.

#### drm/i915

`i915` is an arcane name which signifies the [Intel GFX Driver for DRM](https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/gpu/i915.html). This driver provides DRM with the ability to control graphic chips manufactured by Intel.

The machine I am using has an integrated GPU as part of Intel's chipset (TODO: clean).
Intel's graphics driver is loaded on boot by the DRM, due to the presense of this chipset in my build.
Other folk may have [`drm/amdgpu`](https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/gpu/amdgpu.html) loaded, if they have an AMD Radeon GPU.
Other drivers may be loaded for other chip combinations.

Within the context of this article, we need not know more than the fact that `i915` is the driver `drm` loads to interact with my local graphics hardware.

### BIOS Mode Setting

[VESA BIOS Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_BIOS_Extensions#Linux_video_mode_numbers) define several standard resolution GRUB can set at boot.
(UEFI GOP has superseded VESA BIOS as of 2020, but the standard is still supported `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`)
