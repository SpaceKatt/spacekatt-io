This is the story of how I learned to set custom resolution in Linux for unknown monitors with invalid EDID.

## Intro

Recently, I bought an [Adafruit 7" 800x480 Display Backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2407).

<Image imageUrl="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/2407-12.jpg" />

Minimalist, HMDI capable, and posessing a Swiss Army Knife's versatility, this monitor brought joy to my heart as I imagined the ways it could be used.
Passive heat flowing from a Raspberry Pi brought me warmth from its first successful application, a simple kiosk.

However! Requirements change.

Environnmental considerations pleaded for a new compute mechanism and the introduction of Ubuntu 20.04, replacing the Pi and Raspbian.
Unknown waters as they were, the 7in 800x480 Display's manual provided by Adafruit only covers the operation of the screen with a Pi.
Ubuntu was an entirely different beast.

My first swim ended in sudden, unforgiving _failure_.

Now, we can study why I failed and how you can _succeed!_

Let's dive right in.

## Background

> “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe”
> \- Carl Sagan

An understanding of a system's component requires, almost paradoxically, an understanding of the system.

To understand why a fresh Ubuntu distribution would fail to a blank screen - but only after a few seconds of successfully display at boot, we must first grapple with the basics of Ubuntu's graphics system, the HDMI protocol, and the seven inch Adafruit monitor itself.

### Ubuntu Graphics Environemnt

Ubuntu Desktop comes with a fully functional graphics environment.
To better understand this stack, we briefly explore GNOME, X11, and DRM/KMS.

> Note, this environment is not installed by default on Ubuntu Server.
> However, one could easily set up this environment on Ubuntu Server with `# apt install gnome-session gnome-terminal`.

#### GNOME

GNOME is the desktop environment which comes bundled with Ubuntu 20.04.
As a [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment), it provides the user with a set of menus, icons, and a widget toolkit for building GUI elements.

Ubuntu users are greeted with the GNOME environment after logging in for the first time.

**PIC: Insert GNOME screenshot**

GNOME is an amalgamation of many components.
GNOME Shell, GDM3, dconf, and GTK+, to name a few, come together to provide GNOME with rich functionality and configuration options.
Each component performs a unique function and enables the user to tweak the system in interesting ways.

For instance, [GDM3](https://askubuntu.com/a/829110) is GNOME's display manager and manages the login screen, authentication, and user sessions.
GDM3 may be configured (in `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf`) to provide fun functionality at login, such as [automatic login](https://help.gnome.org/admin/system-admin-guide/stable/login-automatic.html.en) on boot.

GNOME is built on X11 (or Wayland) which in turn handles things like input/output events, a window engine, and a display server.
GDM3 preloads X11 for GNOME Shell, to ensure a visually smooth login experience.

> While [differences between GNOME and X11](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/464321) are beyond the scope of this article,
> we still wish to introduce X11.

#### X11

X11 (a.k.a X, X Window System, X Windows) is a windowing system composed of several components.

The X Server runs the show.
Graphics cards, peripheral input hardware, and the kernel are all operated by the X Server.
Applications (X Clients) are fed input events from the X Server and respond with content to render.
[X.Org (Xorg)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xorg) is a notable, open-source implementation of the X server.

Remote applications may implement the X Protocol and operate over the network.
X11 enables users to access remote desktops with this process, called [X forwarding](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12755/how-to-forward-x-over-ssh-to-run-graphics-applications-remotely).

> [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) is a popular Display Manager and an alternative to Xorg.
> [Differences between Wayland and Xorg](https://www.secjuice.com/wayland-vs-xorg/) are beyond the scope of this article.

#### Linux DRM and KMS

The [Direct Rendering Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Manager) (DRM) is a Linux kernel subsystem which provides an abstraction of the GPU to processes in userspace.

Processes render graphics through DRM by leveraging the `libdrm` API, which facilitates `ioctl()` syscalls to DRM devices at special device files (`/dev/dri/card*`).
The DRM layer functionally acts as a job orchestrator, enabling processes to coordinate GPU hardware acceleration.

> Previously, graphics in Linux were managed with an API called `fbdev` which required programs to directly manage framebuffers - their bitmaps for display.
>
> GPU hardware integration introduced scheduling complexities in framebuffer management.
> Processes would write multiple jobs to a shared, circular buffer as if they were the sole proprieters of the GPU's queue.
> As a result, jobs from separate processes could be scheduled over one another and cause catastrophe.
> Applications experienced undefined behavior as they thrashed to control the device.
>
> The DRM was introduced to manage these scheduling complexities for client applications, handle GPU resource allocation/deallocation, and provide a consistent API across heterogeneous GPU hardware.

[Kernel Mode Setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Manager#Kernel_Mode_Setting) (KMS) is what enables the kernel to set a display mode on the video card (i.e., [mode setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_setting)).
A display mode is defined by a monitor's resolution, color depth, and refresh rate.
Displays will usually declare which modes they support through the [Extended Display Identification Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data) (EDID) metadata format.

Processes leverage the [Graphics Execution Manager](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/gpu/drm-mm.html#the-graphics-execution-manager-gem) (GEM) to construct bitmaps - or framebuffers - and arrange them in planes for layered display.
Each plane can be thought of as a paper cutout, ready to be stacked on other cutouts in a mosaic of planes.

A [CRT Controller](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/gpu/drm-kms.html#crtc-abstraction) (CRTC) is derived from the set display mode and is responsible for creating input planes and output encoders.
Input planes specify the dimensions of graphical bitmaps to be displayed.
Output encoders specify how data should be formatted for any attached connector.

A KMS pipeline is defined by the CRTC, userspace framebuffers to populate the input planes, and connectors to consume output from the encoders.
For example, a framebuffer could represent a graphical application window as bits, and the connector's output could drive an HMDI connected monitor to display that application.

In a nutshell, KMS allows us to create a pipeline from a collection of bitmaps to an encoded output of the system's aggregate display.

> [Cathode-ray tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube) monitors (the CRT in CRTC) are now obsolete.
> However, their design has lasting ripple-effects on the design of modern day protocols.
> Display signal timing and VSYNC/HSYNC signals have their roots in this antiquated technology.

The X Server facilitates much of a GUI's interaction with `libdrm`.

#### drm/i915

`i915` is an arcane name which signifies the [Intel GFX Driver for DRM](https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/gpu/i915.html).
This driver provides DRM with the ability to control graphics chips manufactured by Intel.

Intel's graphics driver is loaded on boot by the DRM, due to the presense of this chipset in my build.
Other folk may have [`drm/amdgpu`](https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/gpu/amdgpu.html) loaded, if they have an AMD Radeon GPU.
Other drivers may be loaded for other chip combinations.

Another way to look at it, `i915` implements the GEM and KMS for Intel graphics hardware in service of the DRM.

Within the context of this article, we need not know more than the fact that `i915` is the driver `drm` loads to interact with my local graphics hardware.

### VESA BIOS Extentions and UEFI GOP

A VESA mode is what tells a computer how to display graphics and set screen resolution at boot.
[VESA BIOS Extentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_BIOS_Extensions#Linux_video_mode_numbers) (VBE) provides the kernel the ability to set the VESA mode.
Monitor resolution, bit depth, and refresh rate settings are all configured by the VESA mode.

The [Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Graphics Output Procotol](https://wiki.osdev.org/GOP) (UEFI GOP) is to UEFI as VBE is to BIOS.
Like IPv6, UEFI GOP's predecessor # TODO: finish this sentence

#### Graphics Environment Summary

VESA BIOS Extentions (or UEFI GOP) allow the machine to display graphics at boot time.
In the first few seconds after booting, the DRM initializes and allows the kernel to to directly control the machine's graphics output.
