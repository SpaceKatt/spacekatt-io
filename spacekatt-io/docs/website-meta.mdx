Here you can find information about the Internation SpaceKatt Station and how it operates.

The [International SpaceKatt Station](/) is a static website built [using Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
Docusaurus was chosen out of several static-site generators because its ease of use, [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) page authoring strategy, and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) integration.
ReactJS is used to create interactive, responsive decorations for the site (such as [minesweeper](/minesweeper)).

Distribution of static files is done with [Google's Content Distribution Network (CDN)](https://cloud.google.com/cdn).
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) makes it easy to [setup a CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/setting-up-cdn-with-bucket) with ["backend bucket" load balancers](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/ext-load-balancer-backend-buckets).
[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) is used for domain registration and DNS configuration while GCP provides the [SSL certificate](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website#lb-ssl) for [https://spacekatt.io](/).
To ensure robust behavior, we also redirect [HTTP->HTTPS in GCP](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-http-https-redirect#partial-http-lb), else folk might accidentally end up on a blank page when fetching from port 80.
