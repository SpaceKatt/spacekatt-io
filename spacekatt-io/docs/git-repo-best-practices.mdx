import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

So, you're creating a new project and need to set up a fresh `git` repository...

Open source projects have a standard set of components engineers expect to see in a repo.

Inclusion of all standard components is a positive signal of the repo maintainer's experience and professionalism.

Exclusion of any of these standard components may provoke a negative bias from the reader.
Engineers often immediately navigate away from projects without these components, as the reader lacks signals of a project's health and reliability.

This guide will teach you how to:

- Set up a new, local repository
- Include standard components industry engineers expect to see
- Curate an open, collaborative environment (with proper guard rails)
- Consider continuous integration, release strategies, testing, linting, and more!

Afterwards, you will have a standardized repository to store your project files that looks like [this example](https://github.com/SpaceKatt/example-fresh-repo) and be familiar with industry best practices.

Let us begin.

:::tip
For this guide I will be using env vars to ease copy-paste.
Please `export` the name of your repository and `GitHub` username to take full advantage of this guide's contents:

```bash
export MY_AWESOME_REPO=<repo-name> && echo $MY_AWESOME_REPO
export GIT_USERNAME=<repo-name> && echo $GIT_USERNAME
```

I am assuming you are using a bash-like shell and plan to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) as an online repo host.

## Initializing a New Local Repo

> *"A library with a thousand downloads begins with a single commit."* - ***idk, probably Torvalds***

Repositories are essentially directories where every change made is tracked and stored for posterity.

**Every** project should [use source control](https://betterprogramming.pub/9-reasons-even-solo-developers-should-use-source-control-c4f5939e2a36).
Without source control, chaos reigns.

`git` is *the* industry favorite tool for source control.
Other tools exist (e.g., Fossil, SVN, CVS, Mercurial, etc...), however they are rare to see out in the wild.

Run the following commands to create a new directory, navigate to it, and create an empty `git` repo:

```bash
mkdir $MY_AWESOME_REPO
cd $MY_AWESOME_REPO
git init
```

Congradulations! You now have an empty `git` repo ready to use for source control excellence!

:::note
Configuration and tracking of `git` history is stored in the `.git/` directory, which has the following structure:

```
.
└── .git
    ├── HEAD
    ├── config
    ├── description
    ├── hooks
    ├── info
    ├── objects
    └── refs
```
:::

If you have not already, please configure your [name and email](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37805844/4656516), as `git` requires it.

Herein, we assume the reader knows basic git operations, such as
[`add`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes),
[`commit`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit),
and [`diff`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-diff).

This guide is **not** a [git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial),
rather it is a compilation of best practices and steps for setting up new repos.

:::note
Industry is shifting towards a preference for naming the default [`git` branch to `main`](https://github.com/github/renaming/#readme).
To change your current branch's name from `master` to `main` and set the default branch name made by future `$ git init` invocations, run the following:

```bash
git branch -m main
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```
:::

## Add a `LICENSE`

> *"Lawsuits are never a fashionable thing to wear."* - **someone who always uses a `LICENSE`**

Software licensing is too often considered a second priority to functionality and overlooked by new coders.

However, one never knows how their code will be used - possibly years later - once it is in the public domain.
Protection from liability is an essential facet of open source software and trivial to implement.

All you need to do is:

- Copy the following [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
- Paste it in a `LICENSE.md` file
- Set the `[year] [fullname]` fields
- Never worry about it again! (Maybe you'll update the `[year]` occasionally)

```txt title="LICENSE.md"
MIT License

Copyright (c) [year] [fullname]

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal

OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.
```

:::info
I prefer a `MIT License` for a variety of reasons, however there are a multitude of available licenses - some of which may be more appropriate for your project!
For instance, the "viral" [`GNU GPLv3 License`](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) is useful if you want  any project taking a dependecy on yours to use the same license.

Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the [common set of licenses](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) used by open source projects.
:::

## Add a `README`

> *"Where's your `README`?"* - **a frusturated engineer**

Projects without a `README` files are persona non grata in the open soure world.

Trust is the coin of the realm, and engineers do not trust projects without a `README`!

Repo hosting websites (such as GitHub) believe in the `README` file to such a degree where they [automatically render `README`s](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in every repo.
Everyone expects you to have one; `README`s are built into the basic muscle memory of the organs of industry.

One of the first few commits in a new repository should create a new `README.md` file.
I typically use the following basic template:

```md title="README.md"
# <REPO_NAME>

<BRIEF_DESCRIPTION_OF_INTENT>
```

Simple scaffolding - such as the template above - is sufficient until you have built out more functionality in your project.

As your project grows, folk should be able to understand what your project is about and how to get started using it by reading the `README`.
If a reader needs to dig around in other files to understand the basics of how to use your project, then those files should be linked to in the `README`.

In a world of growing complexity, the simplest thing you can do to make your project more accessible is having a banger `README`.

## Add a `.gitignore` File

> *"One man's trash is still a bad idea to commit."* - **ancient proverb**

Certain files should *never* be included in source control, such as temporary files, secrets, or build assets.

Luckily, `git` consults a [special `.gitignore` file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) which provides a list of files/patterns to ignore.

Projects will often have their own unique requirements and special cases to ignore.
Typically, I start off new projects with this simple template, then build the list over time:

```txt title=".gitignore"
# common
lib/
tmp/
temp/

# neovim
*.swp
```

## Add a `CONTRIBUTING` Guide

> *"How can I help?"* - **a blessed soul**

Folk love to contribute! Community contributions are the bedrock upon which open source projects lay.

Standards for contribution are typically kept in a special `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
This is the first place members of the community will look if they want to modify some aspect of your repo.

Feel free to copy the [standard template I use](https://github.com/SpaceKatt/example-fresh-repo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) - and modify it to fit your needs.

:::info
If you expect your project to grow in the number of contributors, then please consider making a [code of conduct](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/)!
Humans are complex; it's always a good idea to have a standard bar to which we should treat one another as emotions run high.
:::

## Create Remote Repo (GitHub)

> *"git != GitHub"* - **every git workshop ever**

At some point, you want others to be able to view your project (and an online backup).
Online repository hosting services are plentiful and free to use, so there's no reason you should backup an open source project online.

GitHub is a popular hosting service, and the one we will be using for this guide.

[Create a online repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo#create-a-repository) on GitHub to host your code now.
(I'm assuming you're using the same name you set previously in your `$MY_AWESOME_REPO` env var.)

:::tip
Authentication from the `git` CLI to GitHub can be done in a vairety of ways.
SSH is a standard, secure way to attest your identity and is preferred over HTTPS authenticion in industry.

This guide uses SSH authenticion, to set up SSH locally:
- Generate a [new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key)
- Start an [`ssh-agent` session](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent) to bind keys to
- Add your SSH key to your session

> Replace `zsh` with `bash` or whatever shell you're using!

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
ssh-agent zsh
ssh-add
```

Next, [add your public key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account) to your GitHub profile, then you're all set!
:::

Assuming you've committed your previous changes, it is now time to set your `remote` and `push`!

```bash title="Configure a remote named using SSH protocol and push local commits"
git remote add origin git@github.com:${GIT_USERNAME}/${MY_AWESOME_REPO}.git
git push origin main
```

Now, navigate back to the online repo you created on GitHub to see your code!

## Branch Protection Rules

> *"YOLO Considered Harmful"* - **Gen Z Dijkstra**

[Branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches)
enforce specific methods engineers may use to modify important branches (such as `main`).

Enforcement of simple contribution rules are an excellent way to help keep code quality high and foster a collaborative deveopment environment.
Without branch protection rules, merging can become a frightening, error-prone process.

Set up a [branch protection rule on main](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#creating-a-branch-protection-rule) ***now***.
I recommend two options to always be enabled for rules on `main` branches:

- `Require a pull request before merging`
- `Require status checks to pass before merging`

Pull requests (PRs) allow for spliting changes into related chunks and putting them up for review (by yourself and others).
Protecting `main` by requiring pull requests is the most effective method to avoid merge thrashing among a set of collaborators.

Batching changes into discrete units helps engineers organize their workflows and have greater visibility into how a repo changes over time.
History of which pull requests were merged when is an essential asset which pays divedens for posterity.

Please familiarize yourself on how to [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
and [merge a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request#merging-a-pull-request).

Every engineering team in my industry experience (and a majority of open source projects) use a pull request process.
Thus, knowledge of how to make and review pull requests is prudent.

[Trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) is the de facto industry standard of how to collaborate using `git`.
Every engineer should know and follow trunk based development practices, whether they are developing alone or on a team.

:::note
Decide on the merging strategy you want to use for your project.
Several [methods of merging](https://medium.com/@itsnarayan/types-of-git-merge-in-github-bitbucket-2a7e0fff3876) exist, with their own pros and cons.
Take some time to familiarize yourself with the options available and understand their impact.

When working alone, I prefer to rebase branches locally then use GitHub's [`Rebase and merge`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-commits).
Use of `Rebase and merge` maintains a linear git history and results in more "green squares" in your contribution history. n____n

When working in an enterprise setting, I prefer to rebase branches locally then use GitHub's [`Squash and merge`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-commits).
Squash commits are nice to reduce the commit log noise (i.e., `main` will have thousands of commits instead of tens of thousands of commits).
Rebasing locally first will help maintain a linear git history.

The curious may consult futher reading on [linear history](https://dev.to/bladesensei/avoid-messy-git-history-3g26) (my preferred approach), as there exist pros and cons to this strategy.
:::

Status checks for pull requests are usually defined via continuous integration pipelines, which we will explore next.

## Scaffold Continuous Integration (CI)

[Continuous integration (CI)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)
is a standard development practice which contributes to the health and maintainability of software projects.

Here, we will set up a minimalistic scaffolding for a CI pipeline and use it as a status check on PRs.
If the CI pipeline does not pass on a PR, then the PR should not be merged.

CI pipelines often build, lint, and test changes before passing.
However, in the absence of code, we will create a simple pipeline which only performs a `checkout` of the repo.

We will use [GitHub Actions to create a CI pipeline](https://github.com/readme/guides/sothebys-github-actions). Please create a pipeline file

```bash title="Create CI pipeline manifest file"
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Next, copy the following into the new file.

```yml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2
```

Commit, push, and navigate to the `Actions` tab in your repository to see the pipeline run!

As you add code and add processes to build, lint, and test that code, you should update your CI pipe to reflect those processes.
Ensure the CI pipeline enforces the standards you want to see in your codebase!

:::info
You should add a [status badge](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge) to your [README](https://dev.to/azure/github-how-to-display-the-status-badge-for-a-github-action-5449)!
Everyone likes seeing a `passing` CI status badge linked to the workflow:

[![CI](https://github.com/SpaceKatt/example-fresh-repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SpaceKatt/example-fresh-repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
:::

## Decide on a Release Strategy (CD)

> *"SHIP IT"* - [**gangster squirrel**](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/commit/91b33a64d2be811edc6430f2377eb42b4e8037c5#commitcomment-14367921)

[Continuous delivery (CD)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html)
is a method for shipping your project once it is ready for release.

For example, this webstie is deployed using [this CD pipeline manifest](https://github.com/SpaceKatt/spacekatt-io/blob/main/.github/workflows/cd.yml).
Everytime I push to a branch whose name matches the `release/*` pattern, a new version of the <Link to="/website-meta">spacekatt-io website</Link> is automagically built, tested, and published.

[Release Flow](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/release-flow-how-we-do-branching-on-the-vsts-team/)
is my preferred release strategy. (I'll leave it to the reader to decide if it counts as "CD".)
Other release strategies exist, and one should consider what their release strategy should be from a project's inception.

As CD requires shippable code, setting up a CD pipeline is beyond the scope of this guide.
However, please do create a GitHub Action pipeline manifest as soon as you start deploying code.

:::info
How you release a project will often depend on whether your project is a library or an application.

Libraries are often published to a package manager (using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org)), such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org) for Node.js packages.
Applications are usually deployed to the cloud (i.e., on Azure, GCP, or AWS) over a set infrastructure defined as a declarative manifest (e.g., [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro) or [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep) to implement [infrastructure as code](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/cloud-computing/infrastructure-as-code)).

## Further Considerations

> *"Oh god, there's more?!"* - **the reader**

Engineering fundamentals are essential factors to keep in mind while developing any project.
My favorite guide to standard engineering practices is the [CSE Engineering Fundamentals Checklist](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/ENG-FUNDAMENTALS-CHECKLIST/).

- [Linting](https://webapp.io/blog/linting-best-practices/)
  - Linting is an automated process which enforces a standard coding style and format
  - Linters make your code look pretty!
  - Linters reduce the amount of time you waste formatting your code.
  - Engineers bickering about formatting on PRs is a waste of everyone's time; linters eliminate the need for any formatting bikeshedding
  - Consult language-specific style guides to help you set linter configs
- [Testing](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-test-automation)
  - Testing helps ensure your code does what you say it does!
  - Testing helps prevent regression of functionality as changes accumulate
  - Automated unit testing **should** be included in CI pipelines. PRs should **not** be merged unless all the tests pass
  - Everyone loves seeing projects with high unit test code coverage
- [Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/documentation/)
  - Document design/architecture decisions so folk know what the heck you are doing!
  - I like keeping docs in a `docs/` directory
- Onboarding Guides
  - If you expect the group of people who are developing a project to grow, then you should create a guide to onboard those folk to the project
  - Well written onboarding docs help save time and make your repo more accessible for contributions

Linting and testing are **essential** components of any runnable project, they should be one of the first things you set up once you have running code.

Remember, every project has a different set of requirements.
As you build out your project, research what practices are idiomatic for the domain/language you are developing in.

## Conclusion

Standard components and practices introduced in this guide are language-agnostic and apply broadly to version control repositories.
Engineers across industry expect (by matter of experience and practice) to see all of the elements described above.

After following this guide, your initial repo should look like the [sample repo](https://github.com/SpaceKatt/example-fresh-repo) and have the following directory structure:

```txt title="Final directory structure, excluding .git/"
.
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       └── ci.yml
├── .gitignore
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE.md
└── README.md
```

Thank you for investing in your learning by taking the time to familiarize yourself with git repository best practices.
