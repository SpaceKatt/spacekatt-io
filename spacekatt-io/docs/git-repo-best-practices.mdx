sidebar_label: Git Repo Setup Best Practices

So, you're creating a new project and need to set up a fresh `git` repository...

Open source projects have a standard set of components engineers expect to see in a repo.

Inclusion of all standard components is a positive signal of the repo maintainer's experience and professionalism.

Exclusion of any of these standard components may provoke a negative bias from the reader.
Engineers often immediately navigate away from projects without these components, as they are signals of a project's health and reliability.

This guide will teach you how to:

- Set up a new, local repository
- Include standard components industry engineers expect to see
- Curate an open, collaborative environment (with proper guard rails)
- Consider continuous integration, release strategies, testing, linting, and more!

Let us begin.

:::tip
For this guide I will be using env vars to ease copy paste.
Please `export` the name of your repository to take advantage of this:

```bash
export MY_AWESOME_REPO=<repo-name> && echo $MY_AWESOME_REPO
```

I am also assuming you are using a bash-like shell and have `$USER` as a prexisting env var.

## Initializing a New Local Repo

> *"A library with a thousand downloads begins with a single commit."* - ***idk, probably Torvalds***

Repositories are essentially directories where every change made is tracked and stored for posterity.

**Every** project should [use source control](https://betterprogramming.pub/9-reasons-even-solo-developers-should-use-source-control-c4f5939e2a36).
Without source control, chaos reigns.

`git` is *the* industry favorite tool for source control.
Other tools exist (e.g., Fossil, SVN, CVS, Mercurial, etc...), however they are rare to see out in the wild.

Run the following commands to create a new directory, navigate to it, and create an empty `git` repo:

```bash
mkdir $MY_AWESOME_REPO
cd $MY_AWESOME_REPO
git init
```

Congradulations! You now have an empty `git` repo ready to use for source control excellence!

:::note
Configuration and tracking of `git` history is stored in the `.git/` directory, which has the following structure:

```
.
└── .git
    ├── HEAD
    ├── config
    ├── description
    ├── hooks
    ├── info
    ├── objects
    └── refs
```
:::

If you have not already, please configure your [name and email](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37805844/4656516), as `git` requires it.

Herein, we assume the reader knows basic git operations, such as
[`add`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes),
[`commit`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit),
and [`diff`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-diff).

This guide is **not** a [git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial),
rather it is a compilation of best practices and steps settin up new repos.

:::note
Industry is shifting towards a preference for naming the default [`git` branch to `main`](https://github.com/github/renaming/#readme).
To change your current branch's name from `master` to `main` and set the default branch name made by future `$ git init` invocations, run the following:

```bash
git branch -m main
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

## Add a `LICENSE`



- Add a `LICENSE.md`! I prefer MIT

## Add a `README`

- Add `README.md`

## Add a `.gitignore` File

- Add `.gitignore`

## Add a `CONTRIBUTING` Guide

- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Consider making a code of conduct

## Create Remote Repo (GitHub)

> *"git != GitHub"* - **every git workshop ever**

- Create GitHub repo online
- Set `origin` and `push`
  - `$ git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<my-awesome-repo>.git`
  - `$ git push origin main`

## Branch Protection Rules

Why have branch protection rules?

### Importance of Pull Requests

Pull requests allow for spliting...

[Pull request merging](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request#merging-a-pull-request)

Decide on your merging strategy.

:::note
When working alone, I prefer to rebase branches locally then use GitHub's [`Rebase and merge`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-commits).
Use of `Rebase and merge` maintains a linear git history and

When working in an enterprise setting, I prefer to rebase branches locally then use GitHub's [`Squash and merge`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-commits).
Squash commits are nice to reduce the commit log noise (i.e., `main` will have thousands of commits instead of tens of thousands of commits).

The curious may consult futher reading on [linear history](https://dev.to/bladesensei/avoid-messy-git-history-3g26).

### Setting up Branch Rules

- set rules on `main`

## Scaffold Continuous Integration (CI)

- Add minimal CI
- add CI badge

## Decide on a Release Strategy (CD)

- I like `release/*` CD
- use `spacekatt-io` CD as example

### Libraries vs Applications

TODO: contrast publishing from deployment

## Language Specific Components

Certain standard components are language specific and beyond the scope of this guide.

### Linting

Linting should occur in CI and gate deployment.

### Testing

Testing should occur in CI and gate deployment.

## Further Considerations

### Documentation

Docs

### Onboarding Guides

Onboarding

### Engineering Fundamentals

Please consider engineering fundamentals such as security, observability, and documentation.
